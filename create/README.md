## Quick Start

```bash
npm create rcade@latest
```

That's it! Follow the prompts and you'll have a fully configured game project ready to deploy to the RCade arcade cabinet.

## What You Get

Running `create-rcade` sets up:

- A game project with your chosen template (JS, TS, or Rust)
- Build tooling pre-configured (Vite or Trunk)
- GitHub Actions workflow for automatic deployment
- `rcade.manifest.json` with your game metadata
- Git repository initialized and ready to push

## Interactive Prompts
