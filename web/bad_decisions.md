- no pagination on listing all games :(
- github orgs will break everything :(
- we dont limit file size :(
- errors are just a string :(
- nobody will ever use the rc_id field until the cli is not sucky :(
- we poll every 5 seconds :(
- cache invalidation happens in handlers, should happen in a wrapper class :(
