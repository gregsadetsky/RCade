# RCade

**Build games. Push to GitHub. Play on a real arcade machine.**

RCade is a custom-built arcade cabinet at [The Recurse Center](https://recurse.com) that runs games made by the community. This repo contains everything you need to create, deploy, and play your own arcade games.

---

## Create Your First Game in 60 Seconds

```bash
npm create rcade@latest
```

That's it. Answer a few questions, and you'll have a fully configured game project with automatic deployment to the arcade cabinet.

```sh
? Enter game identifier (e.g. my-game): space-blaster
? Enter display name: Space Blaster
? Enter game description: An epic space shooter
? Game visibility: Public (Everyone can play!)
? Versioning: Automatic (version is incremented every push)
? Starting template: Vanilla (JavaScript)
? Package manager: npm
```

Your game is now ready. Push to GitHub and it deploys automatically.

## How It Works

```
┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐
│   Create    │────>│    Push     │────>│    Play!    │
│  your game  │     │  to GitHub  │     │  on RCade   │
└─────────────┘     └─────────────┘     └─────────────┘
```

1. **Create** - Run `npm create rcade@latest` to scaffold a new game
2. **Build** - Write your game using JavaScript, TypeScript, or Rust
3. **Push** - Push to the `main` branch on GitHub
4. **Deploy** - GitHub Actions automatically builds and deploys to RCade
5. **Play** - Your game appears on the arcade cabinet!

No servers to configure. No deployment scripts to write. No secrets to manage.

## Zero-Config Deployment

When you create a game, RCade automatically sets up a GitHub Actions workflow that:

- Triggers on every push to `main`
- Builds your game
- Deploys it to the RCade cabinet

Here's what gets generated in `.github/workflows/deploy.yaml`:

```yaml
name: Deploy to RCade

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    name: Build and Deploy to RCade
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      id-token: write
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Build steps (auto-configured for your package manager)

      - name: Deploy to RCade
        uses: fcjr/rcade/action-deploy@main
```

**No secrets required!** RCade uses GitHub's OIDC tokens for secure, passwordless authentication. After verifying your GitHub identity, RCade checks that your GitHub account is linked to your Recurse Center profile.

### Deployment Failing?

If your deployment fails with an authentication error, you need to link your GitHub account to your RC profile:

1. Go to [recurse.com/settings/general](https://www.recurse.com/settings/general)
2. Add your GitHub username to your profile
3. Re-run the failed GitHub Action

## Game Templates

Choose your weapon:

| Template | Best For |
|----------|----------|
| **Vanilla JavaScript** | Quick prototypes, simple games |
| **Vanilla TypeScript** | Type-safe development, larger projects |
| **Vanilla Rust** | Performance-critical games, WASM enthusiasts |

All templates come pre-configured with:
- Hot module reloading for fast development
- Optimized production builds
- Automatic GitHub Actions deployment

---

## Using Arcade Controls

RCade has physical arcade controls: two joysticks, buttons for each player, and system buttons. Use the `@rcade/plugin-input-classic` plugin to read them:

```javascript
import { PLAYER_1, PLAYER_2, SYSTEM } from "@rcade/plugin-input-classic";

function gameLoop() {
  // D-pad directions
  if (PLAYER_1.DPAD.up) moveUp();
  if (PLAYER_1.DPAD.down) moveDown();
  if (PLAYER_1.DPAD.left) moveLeft();
  if (PLAYER_1.DPAD.right) moveRight();

  // Action buttons
  if (PLAYER_1.A) fire();
  if (PLAYER_1.B) jump();

  // System buttons
  if (SYSTEM.ONE_PLAYER) startOnePlayerGame();
  if (SYSTEM.TWO_PLAYER) startTwoPlayerGame();

  requestAnimationFrame(gameLoop);
}
```

The plugin is automatically included in your `rcade.manifest.json`:

```json
{
  "dependencies": [
    { "name": "@rcade/input-classic", "version": "1.0.0" }
  ]
}
```

---

## The Manifest File

Every RCade game has an `rcade.manifest.json` that describes your game:

```json
{
  "name": "space-blaster",
  "display_name": "Space Blaster",
  "description": "An epic space shooter",
  "visibility": "public",
  "authors": { "display_name": "Your Name" },
  "dependencies": [
    { "name": "@rcade/input-classic", "version": "1.0.0" }
  ]
}
```

### Visibility Options

| Visibility | Who Can Play |
|------------|--------------|
| `public` | Everyone! |
| `private` | Recursers and people at the Hub |
| `personal` | Only you (great for development) |

### Versioning

- **Automatic** (default): Version increments with every push
- **Manual**: Add `"version": "1.0.0"` to control it yourself

---

## Development Workflow

### Local Development

```bash
cd my-game
npm run dev    # or: bun dev, pnpm dev
```

This starts a local development server with hot reloading. Make changes and see them instantly.

### Deploy to RCade

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add power-ups"
git push
```

That's it. GitHub Actions handles the rest. Watch the Actions tab to see your deployment progress.

### Check Your Game

Once deployed, your game will appear in the RCade game browser. Head to the arcade cabinet at RC to play it!

## Tips for Great Arcade Games

1. **Design for the controls** - You have a joystick and two buttons per player. Keep it simple and satisfying.

2. **Big, bold visuals** - The cabinet has a large screen. Use big sprites, thick lines, and high contrast.

3. **Quick sessions** - Arcade games should be pick-up-and-play. Get players into the action fast.

4. **Two-player support** - The cabinet has controls for two players. Multiplayer games are a hit!

5. **Sound effects** - Add audio feedback for actions. It makes the game feel alive.
